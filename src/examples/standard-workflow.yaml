  - builds Dockerfile
  - development builds are tagged with 'edge'
  - release builds include image tagged with 'latest'
  - docker.io credentials are set with the default ENV variables
  - conftest used to perform cis docker benchmark section 4 tests
  - snyk used to perform scan for cve 
  - bats used to test image configuration, --entrypoint specified as 'ash' to support alpine
