  Standard machine executor workflow demonstrating use of common features.

  - Git push on trunk triggers dev-build, git tag for release
  - builds Dockerfile
  - development builds are tagged with 'edge'
  - release builds include image tagged with 'latest'
  - docker.io credentials are set with the default ENV variables
  - conftest used to perform cis docker benchmark section 4 tests
  - trivy used to perform scan for cve 
  - bats used to test image configuration, --entrypoint specified as 'ash' to support alpine
  - installs all tools onto machine executor
  - uses before-build, before-publish step parameters to configure env vars

usage:
  version: 2.1
